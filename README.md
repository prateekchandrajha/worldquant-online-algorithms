# Worldquant Capstone Project: Developing Online Convex Algorithms For Financial Allocation

Last Updated: 20th January, 2021

Online Algorithms For Financial Trading &amp; Evaluation - Worldquant University Capstone Project

The coding tasks completed until the submission of Draft Project and the tasks yet to be completed with proper timeline
is listed and attached below:
- Fair amount of code explaining and implementing the Online algorithms required for us to simulate online selection/trading is available in the Google Colab notebook in my github: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/Online_Convex_Techniques_Finance_To_Code.ipynb
- I’ve fairly understood and tried to implement the class framework for Follow The Leader family of algorithms in my github: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/Follow_The_Leader_Algorithms_FTRL.ipynb
- I’ll be testing simulations for the algorithms I’ve been building over the past 4 weeks on the S&P dataset
which I’ve kept ready over here: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/SP-500.zip. It still needs some preprocessing and cleaning. I will be doing that in coming week.
- I’ve to add simulations for performance of a host of Online Portfolio Selection algorithms. I’m on verge
of correctly implementing some of the OLPS algorithms listed in this paper by Bin Li, et al, on OLPS
toolbox. The paper can be found in my github repo for this capstone project: 
https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/OLPS_Toolbox_Main_Paper_To_Review.pdf
- In Conclusion, I’d like to add that a proper momentum has been gained to develop the various modules
of this project’s bid to develop an OCO framework for online portfolio and trading selection/management. I’ll
continue that momentum into the next 2 final weeks so that I can deliver an end-to-end working framework for
the implementation of Online Convex Optimization algorithms in wide financial decision making.
