# Worldquant Capstone Project: Developing Online Convex Algorithms For Financial Allocation

Last Updated: 2nd February, 2021

Online Algorithms For Financial Trading &amp; Evaluation - Worldquant University Capstone Project

The coding tasks completed until the FINAL SUBMISSION of Master's Capstone Project and the tasks completed are attached below:
- Fair amount of code explaining and implementing the Online algorithms required for us to simulate online selection/trading is available in the Google Colab notebook in my github: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/Online_Convex_Techniques_Finance_To_Code.ipynb
- I’ve fairly understood and tried to implement the class framework for Follow The Leader family of algorithms (including Follow the Regularized Leader FTRL) over here: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/Follow_The_Leader_Algorithms_FTRL.ipynb
- I’ve done preliminary testing & simulations for the algorithms I’ve been building over the past 6 weeks on the dataset I downloaded from Alpha Vantage using its API Key: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/API_KEY.json
- I tried to add simulations for performance of a host of Online Portfolio Selection algorithms but I haven't been able to finish it before the final project submission date of 2nd February. I’m on verge of correctly implementing some of the OLPS algorithms listed in this paper by Bin Li, et al, on OLPS toolbox which I'll upload after I'm done with the final submission. The paper can be found in my github repo for this capstone project: https://github.com/prateekchandrajha/worldquant-online-algorithms/blob/main/OLPS_Toolbox_Main_Paper_To_Review.pdf
- I've tried to do justice to the capstone project’s bid to develop an OCO framework for online portfolio and trading selection/management.
